    ## About this documentation

    This is an unofficial documentation of the API that is used in the project [https://sensor.community](https://sensor.community).

    The source code of this documentation is at [https://github.com/bessarabov/api.sensor.community](https://github.com/bessarabov/api.sensor.community). Feel free to create Pull Request with bug fixes or improvements.

    Maybe, someday this API documentation will be adopted as official and it will be shown at [https://api.sensor.community](https://api.sensor.community) and the source code will be moved to [https://github.com/opendata-stuttgart](https://github.com/opendata-stuttgart). But for now this is just an unofficial attempt to create documentation.

    This documentation is created with openapi/swagger. It is interactive. You can enter values in for the endpoints and see here the results of the requests right in the browser.
